# Intelligent Human Detection System
This project uses an Arduino, a PIR sensor, and OpenCV to create an intelligent human detection system. The system detects changes in infrared radiation when a person enters a room and activates a camera to confirm human presence. If no movement is detected, the camera reactivates to verify if the person is still present but not moving or has left.
# Description 
The Intelligent Human Detection System combines hardware and software components to monitor and detect human presence in a room. The PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor is used to detect changes in infrared radiation, indicating movement. When movement is detected, the system activates an OpenCV camera to confirm human presence. If the PIR sensor detects no movement, the camera reactivates to determine if the person is still there but not moving or has left the room.
# Features
1.Human Detection: Detects human presence using a PIR sensor and OpenCV.
2.Movement Confirmation: Confirms human presence when movement is detected.
3.Non-Movement Detection: Reactivates the camera to confirm if a person is still present when no movement is detected.
# Components
1.Arduino
2.PIR Sensor
3.Camera (compatible with OpenCV)
4.Computer with OpenCV installed
